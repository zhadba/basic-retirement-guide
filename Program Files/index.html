<!--Planning Methods-->

<section class="planning-methods">
    <h1>PLANNING METHODS</h1>
    <p>With so many models for planning, there is some flexibility in terms of the approach
    that you choose to employ. Here are some general pointers that will aid the process regardless of model.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="method-col">
            <h3>SAVING</h3>
            <p>Consider the basic principle of compound interest. A smaller amount of money 
            invested <b>consistently</b> from a young age will be able to amass a larger value than a large amount
            of money invested at a later age. Once the ability to open a bank account becomes available to you,
            it is best to set aside a few dollars every month to a dedicated retirement account. Over the course
            of 30-40 years of constant compounding montly additions, a few thousand dollars can turn into <b>1 million</b>
            or more (depending on the bank), leaving plenty of room for other priorities to be handled by pension funds. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="method-col">
            <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
            <p>Informing oneself of the many available options for planning and saving is the most <b>important</b>
            step in retirement education. This site only covers the very basics. Consider reading up on <a href="#">these sites</a> 
            to be better prepared. Unfortunately, many school systems (at least in Texas) do not offer a standardized 
            financial literacy class, which leaves many students <b>without</b> sufficient knowledge of money management, hence why
            these resources are so important to the average young person. Read, read, read! It's never too early to start!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="method-col">
            <h3>RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</h3>
            <p>Education and saving overlap to create resource management, since proper management
            will include money and the knowledge of how to handle it. However, it is also highly variable, since many
            career paths will offer very <b>different</b> approaches to resource management. As such, it is important to read up on
            services that your ideal job(s) will offer, since many employers have benefits that many employees do not know 
            about. In general, though, try to consolidate all of your 401ks and other pension benefits into <b>one place</b>, 
            so that, even if you have many jobs throught your career, everything will be easily accessible when the time comes.
